From my local Jenkins, I am trying to create a VPC with public and private zone.
The CIDR block, public and private zone, region and AWS key and secrets are taken as variable from my local jenkins.

How to run this scripts
==============================

To run this example you need to execute:

```````
#terraform init
#terraform plan
#terraform apply
#terraform destroy
``````
Note: Here I am not using any variable replacements.
